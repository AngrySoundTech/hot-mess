# hot-mess

This web app was made for RIT Tech Crew's 2017 Relay for Life fundraiser with Firebase and Angular.

Having to be made in a week however, there are many glaring flaws and this should not be seen as a strong example of our work.

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.

## Deploying

1. Run `grunt build`
2. Run `firebase deploy`
